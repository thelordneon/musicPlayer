A **modern web-based music player** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It combines research from multiple sources, code experiments, and “vibe coding” sessions to reach its current state.  

⚠️ **Note**: Since this was crafted experimentally, there may still be **bugs or edge cases**.  
Community contributions are welcome to refine and fix issues.
